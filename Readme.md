Communication for Deaf and Mute Persons using Machine Learning
This Github repository contains the source code for a machine learning model that enables communication for deaf and mute persons.

Project Overview
The main goal of this project is to create a system that can recognize sign language and convert it into text and/or speech. This is achieved by training a machine learning model on a large dataset of sign language gestures. The model is then able to recognize these gestures in real-time, allowing for seamless communication between deaf and mute persons and those who do not understand sign language.

Technologies Used
Python
OpenCV
TensorFlow
Keras
